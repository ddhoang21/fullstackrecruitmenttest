# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

I added React-Bootstrap framework and used it for design as there were issues with BPK while using Next.js.

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

`npm start`

---

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

I would have rendered the cards in a loop function instead of hard coding them. I would also have added functionality to the "select" button to lead it to another page (maybe where we could pick seats).

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

I'm most proud of the functions that I added to display the format requested because it took me some time to understand the math. I'm also proud that I was able to build and deploy the test using Next.js because I wasn't familiar with it. I'm happy that the project matches the intended design because that part matters most to me.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

I spent the most time trying to create a function to map through the data in order to render the cards. I was able to figure out pieces of it but wasn't able to finish that task due to time limitation (I told you I would give this test back to you on April 26th). I will definitely keep working on this issue after submission.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

The test was pretty straight forward. I learned new things while working on it which is always fun.
I didn't have any issues completing the test but I still have my head stuck around the function mentioned above.

As for improvements, I believe upgrading everything so we could start the test as soon as we clone the repo would be very beneficial. In order to start the project, I had to downgrade node to the version 12 which took some time to figure out. 
There are also issues in the modules with BPK and Next.js which is why I wasn't able to use it (I was able to implement the styleguide provided in a create-react-app project though).
The length of the departure and arrival time provided didn't always match the length of the flight which was a bit confusing.
I wasn't able to figure out how to access the logos so I took images from Google but this isn't a big deal.
